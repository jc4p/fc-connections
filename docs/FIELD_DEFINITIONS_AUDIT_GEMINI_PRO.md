Okay, this is an exciting challenge! You're absolutely right â€“ the questions are the bedrock of engagement and rich data. Let's overhaul these field definitions to make FC-Connections incredibly sticky and insightful.

**Core Principles Applied:**

*   **Self-Discovery Journey:** Frame questions as prompts for introspection. The user learns about themselves as they answer.
*   **Curiosity Gap & Personalization:** Tease insights or compatibility scores based on answers. "Answer 3 more questions to unlock your 'Connection Style'!"
*   **Narrative & Storytelling:** Encourage users to tell mini-stories, not just list facts.
*   **Forced Choice (Sometimes):** "Would you rather..." questions can reveal underlying priorities.
*   **Indirect Probing:** Instead of "Are you empathetic?", ask "What's a small act of kindness you recently witnessed or performed that stuck with you?"
*   **Future Pacing & Ideal Self:** Questions about ideal scenarios tap into aspirations.
*   **Emotional Elicitation:** Questions that trigger mild emotional responses (humor, nostalgia, aspiration) are more memorable.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Start lighter, then offer opportunities for deeper sharing, perhaps in optional "Advanced Profile" sections.

**General Gamification & Stickiness Elements (Applicable Across Profiles):**

1.  **Profile Completeness Score/Meter:** Visually gratifying.
2.  **"Insight Unlocked!":** After answering a set of questions, provide a small, interesting "insight" about them (e.g., "Based on your answers, you're a 'Curious Explorer' when it comes to new experiences!").
3.  **"Daily Spark" or "Weekly Deeper Dive":** A single, thought-provoking question delivered via notification to encourage re-engagement and profile updates. Answers could be shareable (if desired).
4.  **"People like you also enjoy X":** Based on answers, suggest interests or activities, creating a feedback loop.
5.  **"Compatibility Glimpse":** When viewing other profiles, show *why* they might be a match based on specific shared or complementary answers to these deeper questions. E.g., "You both believe trust is built through consistent actions!"
