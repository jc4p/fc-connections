# Async Standup Notes - Product Manager - Week 1, Day 1

**Session Focus:** Reviewing initial development progress against Week 1 goals, ensuring alignment with MVP requirements, and identifying key priorities and potential risks.

## Summary of Progress (PM Perspective)

The team has made solid foundational progress on Day 1.

*   **Backend (Dev 1):** Cloudflare Workers setup is complete, the database schema is implemented and seeded, and core profile endpoints are in place. Farcaster authentication exists but requires testing. Good start on the backend infrastructure.
*   **Frontend (Dev 2):** Next.js project is initialized with the correct routing structure. Basic Frame V2 integration is done, allowing FID retrieval. Page shells for all key views are created, adopting the Server/Client component pattern. Initial styling (font) is applied. Basic API client helpers are ready.

Overall, the groundwork is being laid correctly according to the technical requirements outlined in [`MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`](../../docs/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Week 1 Deliverable Check-in ([`DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md`](../../docs/DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md))

Let's assess our progress towards the Week 1 deliverables:

**Developer 1 (API/Backend Focus):**
*   [✅] Working development environment (Cloudflare Workers setup).
*   [✅] Functional database with proper schema.
*   [🟡] Basic API endpoints with Farcaster authentication (`POST /users` needs testing, several key endpoints still missing - see Blockers).
*   [✅] Seed script for profile field definitions (via `schema.sql`).

**Developer 2 (Frontend Focus):**
*   [✅] Working development environment (Next.js setup).
*   [🟡] Homepage with navigation to profile creation (Basic homepage layout exists, but needs UI refinement and potentially client-side logic for dynamic content like profile status). Profile type selection UI not explicitly mentioned as complete.
*   [🟡] Custom navigation context for mini-app behavior (Not started - **Risk** if not addressed soon).
*   [🟡] Reusable components (Placeholders exist, need implementation).
*   [🟡] Design system basics (Font added, colors defined in [`MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`](../../docs/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md) but need systematic application).

**Overall Week 1 Goal:** `Working development environment and basic navigation`
*   **Status:** Mostly on track. Dev environments are up. Basic navigation is structurally present via page files, but the *custom navigation context* is a key missing piece for the intended "mini-app behavior" and needs prioritization.

## Key Issues / Blockers / PM Focus

1.  **Missing Critical API Endpoints:** The frontend team will soon be blocked without `GET /api/field-definitions/:type` and `GET /api/users/:fid/profiles`. These are essential for dynamic forms (Core MVP Feature #1/2) and the 'My Profiles' page (Core MVP Feature). **Dev 1 must prioritize these.**
2.  **Custom Navigation Context:** This requirement from the timeline is crucial for the desired mini-app feel and preventing standard browser navigation which might break the Frame context. **Dev 2 needs to allocate time for this soon.** It impacts the overall UX.
3.  **Frontend Component Implementation:** While placeholders are good for structure, the actual UI components (`DynamicForm`, `ProfileCard`, etc.) are needed to realize the core features (Profile Creation, Discovery). **Dev 2's focus should be on building these.**
4.  **API Authentication Testing:** The `POST /api/users` endpoint needs verification to ensure the Farcaster authentication flow works end-to-end.
5.  **Design System Implementation:** While basic font/colors are noted, consistent application across components is needed to meet the brand guidelines in [`MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`](../../docs/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md). This should happen as components are built.

## Next Steps / Guidance for Devs (Day 2)

**Developer 1 (API/Backend):**
1.  **Absolute Priority:** Implement and test `GET /api/field-definitions/:type` and `GET /api/users/:fid/profiles`.
2.  **High Priority:** Implement `DELETE /api/profiles/:id`.
3.  Add pagination to `GET /api/profiles`.
4.  Test the `POST /users` authentication flow.

**Developer 2 (Frontend):**
1.  **Absolute Priority:** Begin implementation of the `DynamicForm` component. This unblocks profile creation/editing, a core MVP feature.
2.  **High Priority:** Start building the `ProfileCard` component for the browse view.
3.  **Consider:** Allocate some time to investigate or start implementing the `custom navigation context` to mitigate the risk identified.
4.  Continue integrating API calls using the `lib/api.js` client as needed for component development.
5.  Start applying brand colors and spacing systematically as components are built.

By focusing on these priorities, we can ensure the frontend isn't blocked and we stay on track for demonstrating core profile creation and basic browsing capabilities by the end of Week 2, while ensuring the critical Week 1 navigation goal is met.
