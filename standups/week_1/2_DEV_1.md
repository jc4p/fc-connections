# Async Standup Notes - Dev 1 - Week 1, Day 2

**Session Focus:** Implementing critical API endpoints identified in Day 1 standup and PM feedback.

## Summary of Progress (Day 2)

*   **Implemented Field Definitions Endpoint:**
    *   Created `api/src/routes/definitions.js`.
    *   Added `GET /api/field-definitions/:type` endpoint to fetch form fields based on profile type (`partner`, `friend`, `job`).
    *   Registered the new route in `api/src/index.js`.
    *   _Status:_ Completed. Unblocks Dev 2 for dynamic form creation.
*   **Implemented User Profiles Endpoint:**
    *   Added `GET /api/users/:fid/profiles` endpoint to `api/src/routes/users.js`.
    *   Fetches all profile summaries (id, type, status, etc.) for a given Farcaster ID.
    *   _Status:_ Completed. Unblocks Dev 2 for the 'My Profiles' page.
*   **Implemented Profile Deletion Endpoint:**
    *   Added `DELETE /api/profiles/:id` endpoint to `api/src/routes/profiles.js`.
    *   Allows deletion of a specific profile by its ID. Leverages `ON DELETE CASCADE` in DB schema for related `profile_field_values`.
    *   _Status:_ Completed. Enables profile management functionality.
*   **Added Pagination to Profile Browsing:**
    *   Modified `GET /api/profiles` in `api/src/routes/profiles.js`.
    *   Removed hardcoded `LIMIT 50`.
    *   Added support for `limit` (default 20) and `offset` (default 0) query parameters.
    *   Changed default sort order to `created_at DESC`.
    *   Included basic pagination metadata (`total`, `limit`, `offset`) in the response.
    *   _Status:_ Completed. Addresses scalability for browsing.

## Week 1 Goal Check-in (`DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md`)

**Developer 1 (API/Backend Focus):**

*   [âœ…] Set up Cloudflare Workers project structure with proper routing (Day 1).
*   [âœ…] Implement D1 database schema with all tables and indexes (Day 1).
*   [âœ…] Create seed script for profile field definitions (Day 1).
*   [ðŸŸ¡] Develop and test basic user authentication with Farcaster ID (fid) (`POST /api/users` exists, still needs focused testing).
*   [âœ…] Implement user profile endpoints (GET/POST) (Core GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for profiles now exist. `GET /api/users/:fid/profiles` also added).
*   [âœ…] **(Implicit Goal):** Implement dynamic field definitions API (Completed today with `GET /api/field-definitions/:type`).

**Overall Week 1 Status:** Mostly on track. Core profile CRUD and supporting endpoints (definitions, user profiles) are implemented. The main remaining task is testing the Farcaster authentication (`POST /api/users`).

## Blockers / TODOs for Tomorrow (Day 3)

1.  **Testing `POST /api/users`:** Need to verify the create/update user flow, especially how it interacts with Farcaster authentication assumptions.
2.  **Review Missing API Endpoints (from Day 1 notes):**
    *   **View Tracking:** `GET /api/profiles/:id` currently increments views. Revisit if a separate `POST /api/profiles/:id/view` is preferred (as noted in Day 1 standup). Discuss with PM/Dev 2.
    *   **Reporting:** `POST /api/report` (Missing - needs DB schema discussion/update + route). Lower priority for MVP Week 1/2? Check `MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
3.  **Code Refinement:** Review error handling and add basic input validation where necessary (e.g., ensuring FID is a number).

**Priority for tomorrow:** Focus on testing the existing `POST /api/users` endpoint to ensure the core auth/user creation flow is solid. Then, assess the necessity and priority of the separate view tracking and reporting endpoints for the MVP.
