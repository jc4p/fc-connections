# Async Standup Notes - Product Manager - Week 1, Day 2

**Session Focus:** Reviewing Day 2 progress against Week 1 goals and MVP requirements, assessing the impact of completed tasks, and setting clear priorities for Day 3.

## Summary of Progress (PM Perspective)

Day 2 saw exceptional progress, particularly on the frontend, significantly de-risking core functionality.

*   **Backend (Dev 1):** Successfully addressed the critical API gaps identified yesterday. The implementation of `/field-definitions`, `/users/:fid/profiles`, and `/profiles/:id` (DELETE) unblocks major frontend features (dynamic forms, 'My Profiles', delete functionality). Adding pagination to `/profiles` is also a crucial step for future scalability. The main outstanding item is testing the user creation/authentication flow.
*   **Frontend (Dev 2):** Made substantial leaps. The `DynamicProfileForm` implementation and integration are huge wins, tackling a complex piece early. The creation of `ProfileCard` provides a key component for discovery. Critically, the implementation of `FrameContext` elegantly solves the FID management and potential navigation issues highlighted yesterday, fulfilling the "custom navigation context" goal implicitly. Secure API key handling and CSS Module setup are also solid foundational steps.

Overall, the team is demonstrating strong velocity. Dev 1 efficiently closed crucial backend gaps, and Dev 2 tackled complex frontend tasks, including resolving the FID context challenge proactively.

## Week 1 Deliverable Check-in ([`DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md`](../../docs/DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md))

Let's assess our progress towards the Week 1 deliverables based on end-of-day 2 status:

**Developer 1 (API/Backend Focus):**
*   [âœ…] Working development environment (Cloudflare Workers setup).
*   [âœ…] Functional database with proper schema.
*   [ðŸŸ¡] Basic API endpoints with Farcaster authentication (`POST /users` needs testing, but core profile/supporting endpoints are now complete).
*   [âœ…] Seed script for profile field definitions.
*   [âœ…] **(Implied Week 2 Goal Started):** Dynamic field definitions API (`GET /api/field-definitions/:type` completed).

**Developer 2 (Frontend Focus):**
*   [âœ…] Working development environment (Next.js setup).
*   [âœ…] Homepage with navigation to profile creation (Homepage layout exists, dynamic client logic integrated via `HomepageClient`, create/edit flows use `DynamicProfileForm`). Profile type selection UI is implicitly handled by the create flow.
*   [âœ…] Implement custom navigation context for mini-app behavior (Achieved via `FrameContext` implementation).
*   [ðŸŸ¡] Build reusable components (back button, loading states, etc.) (`DynamicProfileForm`, `ProfileCard` built. Loading/error states and back button need proper implementation).
*   [âœ…] Set up CSS modules configuration (Implemented and used in key components).
*   [âœ…] Create design system basics (colors, typography, spacing) (Base styles defined in `globals.css`, CSS Modules used, brand colors applied in `ProfileCard`).

**Overall Week 1 Goal:** `Working development environment and basic navigation`
*   **Status:** Essentially met and exceeded. Dev environments are stable, core API endpoints are mostly ready (pending auth test), basic navigation structure is in place, and the critical 'mini-app' context requirement is addressed. Significant progress has been made on Week 2 goals (dynamic form).

## Key Issues / PM Focus / Risks

1.  **API Authentication Testing:** The `POST /api/users` endpoint functionality remains the primary unknown on the backend. Verification is needed to ensure the user creation/login flow works as expected. **Dev 1's top priority.**
2.  **Frontend Component Implementation:** While the dynamic form and card are done, the client components for core pages (`BrowseClient`, `MyProfilesClient`, `ProfileDetailClient`) need implementation to bring the user flows together. **Dev 2's main focus.**
3.  **Visual Polish & Reusable UI:** Basic text loading/error states need replacement with polished UI elements (skeletons, proper error messages). Consistent application of the design system (`MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md`) across new components is key. This includes potentially a custom back button if `FrameContext` isn't sufficient for all navigation scenarios.
4.  **Lower Priority API Items:**
    *   View Tracking: The current `GET` increment might be sufficient for MVP. Let's defer the decision on a separate `POST` endpoint until we see usage patterns or identify specific needs.
    *   Reporting: Likely non-MVP. Defer implementation unless critical issues arise.

## Next Steps / Guidance for Devs (Day 3)

**Developer 1 (API/Backend):**
1.  **Absolute Priority:** Thoroughly test the `POST /api/users` endpoint and workflow. Document findings or necessary fixes.
2.  **Secondary:** Review code for basic input validation and error handling improvements.
3.  **Standby:** Be available to support Dev 2 with any API integration questions or minor adjustments needed for frontend implementation.

**Developer 2 (Frontend):**
1.  **Absolute Priority:** Implement the client components for **Browse (`BrowseClient`)** and **My Profiles (`MyProfilesClient`)**. Integrate `ProfileCard` and necessary API calls (`GET /api/profiles` with pagination, `GET /api/users/:fid/profiles`, `DELETE /api/profiles/:id`).
2.  **High Priority:** Begin implementation of `ProfileDetailClient`, fetching and displaying full profile data.
3.  **Ongoing:** Start replacing placeholder loading/error states with more robust UI components as new views are built. Continue applying consistent styling based on `globals.css` and brand guidelines.
4.  **Testing:** Perform basic manual testing of the create/edit/delete flows now that the backend endpoints are available.

Fantastic work on Day 2! By focusing on these priorities for Day 3, we'll solidify the core user flows (discovery, management) and be in an excellent position heading into Week 2.
