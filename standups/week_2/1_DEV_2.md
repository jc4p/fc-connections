*   **Navigation Issues (Partial Fix):**
    *   Attempted to fix X button navigation in create forms with `router.back()` and `router.push('/')`
    *   **Status:** üî¥ BLOCKER. X button on create listing page still not working - neither router method has any effect
    *   **TODO:** Investigate why Next.js router navigation is failing in create forms

*   **CSS Module Conversion:**
    *   Converted all components to use CSS modules instead of Tailwind
    *   Created consistent styling patterns across all components
    *   **Status:** üü° In Progress. Main components done, might need polish on edge cases.

1.  **CRITICAL: Fix X Button Navigation:**
    *   X button on create listing page completely non-functional 
    *   Neither `router.back()` nor `router.push('/')` work at all

2.  **Edit Profile Flow:**
    *   Update `EditProfileClient` to match new design system
    *   Ensure it uses same styling as CreateProfileClient
    *   Test edit ‚Üí save ‚Üí navigation flow

3.  **Loading States & Polish:**
    *   Replace remaining "Loading..." text with proper skeleton loaders
    *   Add proper empty states for browse pages with no results
    *   Polish any remaining visual inconsistencies

3.  **Testing & QA:**
    *   Manual testing of all flows: Homepage ‚Üí Browse ‚Üí Profile Detail ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Edit
    *   Test navigation edge cases and error handling
    *   Verify all components work with Frame context

### üîÑ Medium Priority
4.  **API Integration Testing:**
    *   Test actual profile creation/editing with backend
    *   Verify data flow and error handling works end-to-end
    *   Check pagination and filtering in browse pages

5.  **Performance & UX:**
    *   Add optimistic updates for profile actions
    *   Implement proper form validation feedback
    *   Add loading states for form submissions

### üìù Nice-to-Have
6.  **Enhanced Features:**
    *   Add filter functionality to browse pages
    *   Implement proper image handling for profile pictures
    *   Add more sophisticated profile field rendering

## Notes for Tomorrow
*   Designer mockups successfully implemented - app now looks professional and cohesive
*   All major user flows are functional with new design system
*   Focus should be on polish, testing, and ensuring edit flow matches create flow
*   Frame context and navigation are working smoothly now
*   Ready to move into final testing and refinement phase

**Overall Status:** üü¢ Strong progress. Design implementation successful, major components complete. Ready for polish and testing phase.
